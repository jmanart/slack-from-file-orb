  Use the "branch_pattern" parameter to limit notifications to specified branches.
  Useful when a job is executed on multiple branches but you only wish to be notified on a subset of branches.
  For example: If your "build" job runs on every branch, but you wish to only be notified when a failure occurs on the "main" branch, your config may look like this.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    slack: jmanart/slack-from-file@1.0
  jobs:
    build:
      machine: true
      steps:
        - run: echo "{\"blocks\":{\"type\":\"divider\"}}" > body.txt
        - slack-from-file/notify:
          body: body.txt
  workflows:
    deploy_and_notify:
      jobs:
        - build:
            context: slack-secrets
        # This deploy job uses the native CircleCI workflow filters to specify that the entire job will not execute unless on the specified filtered branch.
        # This Workflow level filter is independent from the Slack orb, and controls if the entire job is executed, as opposed to just the command in the orb.
        - deploy:
            requires:
              - build
            filters:
              branches:
                only:
                  - production
